  "la_storia_text" : "“Li Chiani“ in the local dialect means flat land characterized mainly by outcropping rock. In this area, in the past, the peasants reclaimed the land by pitting them to make them fertile and suitable for planting typical native crops (figs and prickly pears, vines and olive groves, capers, etc.). The typical architecture of the Lower Salento (pajare, lamioni, dry stone walls, etc.) was created with the stone obtained from the stone removal. Villa LiChiani was born in the early eighties and is mainly used in the summer in order to allow the property to enjoy a period of well-deserved rest. In 2017, to coincide with the year dedicated to sustainable tourism, Villa Li Chiani undergoes a profound and substantial restyling that gives the house a modern design that is at the same time compatible with local and Mediterranean tradition. Thus was born iChiani - Charming & Sustainable Holidays The real strength of iChiani - Charmig & Sustainable Holidays is the regeneration from an energy and environmental sustainability point of view which makes it completely independent from fossil energy sources. The CasaClima certification (prot. Nr. 2017/01278) certifies the energy quality and comfort achieved. iChiani - Charming & Sustainable Holidays is located on the Via Leucadensis which is the ancient “Way of forgiveness“. On this road, since the Middle Ages, pilgrims from all over the Salento peninsula have traveled to the Sanctuary of Santa Maria di Leuca “De Finibus Terrae“.",

  "la_villa_text" : "“Charming & Sustainable Holidays“ \n is our motto… This was possible through the reinterpretation, in a contemporary key, of the rural tradition of Puglia and Salento. iChiani is a design villa with swimming pool in Gagliano del Capo that expresses the desire to rediscover the physicality of traditional materials. Given the presence of 4 bedrooms served by 3 bathrooms, iChiani offers 8 beds (+2 optional). Sublime location for a romantic getaway among the sweet olive groves of the Serre del Salento, iChiani was created to seduce the most demanding guests in terms of comfort, sustainability and privacy. A villa that resizes the concept of full and empty, the watchword is: space. The location allows you to move easily to the most beautiful places on the Salento peninsula and to the many beaches ranging from the Adriatic to the Ionian coast. To brighten your stay, the modern swimming pool with a panoramic view of the olive grove. Simple expression of an imposing and light architecture, it is proud and respectful of the surrounding nature. The night atmosphere is also breathtaking. The interiors are customized through minimal-chic furnishing elements that outline the style. The materials used enhance the soft colors of the Salento stone and the white of the rooms gives brightness and freshness. The main house, located in a dominant position over the olive grove, is equipped with a comfortable living area, four bedrooms (three with double beds and one with single beds joined or divisible), each with its own bathroom / shower, and a service toilet. The terraces, loggias and outdoor furniture represent the perfect synthesis between luxury and tradition. Externally it is also possible to use an additional private bathroom / shower for an excellent after-pool. Privacy is further guaranteed by an alarm system connected to the police. Our team offers iChiani guests, on request, a wide choice of exclusive services in the villa.",
